- we are trying to see how well these stores are doing
so the first thing we should look at is the offers and sales associated with those offers
the offers are : Chicken sales, Pizza sales, Bean To Cup Sales,Frozen Yogurt sales and Door Dash Sales
in these offers we have some null values and empty spaces.
- We also need to evaluate for the stores:
Not all the stores are open for the same list of time
so it probably better to create some sort of an avarage of the days open and the sales.
and we would divide by the sales by the number of days open to give us, to get a uniform normalized way of looking at
the data.
on chicken values we will them with zeros because they are the days we were not selling.
then we would need to group by our store or location type, to understand how those offers are doing.
Create a mix of those offers by adding them together, and dividing each by tottal to get the proportion of each of the mixtures


-> Heading To Power Query(Data Transformation)
Data->from table-> this will bring us to power query which will make us manipulate the data in a model
in "store type", we had 5.5, and we have 6K so we sould change that, so that we can tell our manager
so that they can tell us if it was the right approach or not.
1-highlight the "store type"->transform->replace values->replace 6K with 5.5K
or use formulae in fx= Table.ReplaceValue(#"Changed Type","6 K","5.5 K",Replacer.ReplaceText,{"Store Type"})
2-Hanadling null values- Highlight last coloumn to the first integer coloumn(data store column)
replace value->null with zero(0)
-Rename the table on queries as "our clean table"

-Now we want to add our rate columns to our table, this is easier to do in excel tab, but we are going to do them in
power query
-duplicate the table, rename the duplicate to "Rate table"
remove store name and number,
we are going to take all of our amount and divide by the days the store is open by creating new coloumns
-add custom coloumn->[Inside Sales]/[Days Store Open]- Inside Sales Per day
-add custom coloumn->[Hot Food Sales]/[Days Store Open]- Hot Food Sales Per Day, do this up until door dash
-delete tables we dont need- "Inside sales" to "Door Dash Sales"
Close and Load

- we are now going to create pivot tables in our queries(Tables)
double click on one of the tables-> go to rate table
we want to get some queries based on our queries-> we ant to group according to the store type
-we want to know overall average store perday for "store type"
->select group by(home tab)->advanced,store type-new coloumn name:days open, operation:average,Coloumn name:days store open
do for everything- up to doordash
advanced let us have more aggregations
close and load

Now that we have offers that are segmented by the store type,
lets start to create our offer mix by creating a new tab and copying the avg offers(pvot 1 ) to the new table and start our calculatons
we know that the sum of  each one of these rows is going to be all of the offers in the row
-so we want to divide each one of these offers by the sum to get their propotion.
=D5/SUM(D5:H5)
if we want to drag to the row, we put a dolla sign on the above value and drag the row
fx=D5/SUM($D5:$H5)
this should ggive us offer mix-so these should equal one hundred as they are proportions of each other
sum of each one of these rows should be 1(100%)
-now we need to highlight our offers and change to %-how->&

now we can answer our question.
which is: what are the offers that we could use at each one of these store types
-we have historical data to use that off and all we need to do is write up a summary of these offer mixes and
we should be able to answer ourr first question
-Select all the offers percentage->insert->recommended charts->column chart

The problem with the chart is that we see offer mixes instead of store type so what we need to do is unpivot the data
we need to switch from column to row
so we are going to: Go back to power query and go to data->from table range-powerquery opens
power query->renema on quries to "unpivot"->
go to "Transform"->select coloumns we want to inpivot(offers from chicken to doordsh)unpivot coloumns->
rename attribute-> Offer,value->Percentage(This is how we narrow our data opposed to making it wide as in multiple coloumns)
copy the unpivot table on the same query
Create a pivot chart based on the unpivot table

go to insert->pivot chart->new work_sheet
sheet6->
take percentage->values
store type->axis
offer->Legend

we built our recommendations.

-now we are going to copy our  Rate table onto a new sheet to form a correlation.
using corrrel fuction, to correlate inside guest count per day and our offers
